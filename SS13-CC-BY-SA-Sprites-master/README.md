SS13 CC-BY-SA Sprites 
=====================

This repo's purpose is to be a location for **ONLY** sprites that were made under the [CC-BY-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).  This will allow other developers who might be working on apps or games to use the artwork in their projects for commercial purposes.

*DISCLAIMER*
------------

There are two folders in the repo that seperates the sprites into two categories.  

* **Legitimate** - sprites that have been vetted as orginal. (okay to use)
* **Dubious** - sprites that could possibly be derivatives. (use at your own risk) 

The Purpose
===========

Given the *immense* history that is SS13, there have been many forks and changes over time.  One of the most famous branch's, [r4407](https://github.com/nullbear/Goonstation_SS13_r4407), is a predeccessor to much code and artwork.  The artists, coders, and team who made this were from the SomethingAwful forums who called themselves the goons.  Thus it is referred to as 'goon' code or the 'goon' server/community.  To see the full history [look here](https://tgstation13.org/wiki/The_history_of_SS13).  Other groups of people began to use and modify the code and artwork from the r4407 branch into their own servers and communities.

Unfortunately, r4407's art assets was licensed under a [CC-BY-NC-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). (no commercial use)  This conflicts with some of the art assets that other groups (tg, bay, etc.) have made that are licensed under [CC-BY-SA license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/). (commercial use allowed)

The art assets for the goon was not seperated into their own folder or area when other groups continued to add artwork.  Thus, many of the sprites were mixed together making it hard to determine where a sprite orginated from.   

The End Result
==============  

I spent a considerable amount of time comparing r4407's art assets to tg's.  There were thousands of sprites that were sorted through meticiolously to find any matching patterns or identity.  If any sprites matched they were pruned and removed.

Overall, roughly 30-45% of the artwork from the current tg branch was a goon reskin or copy that was removed.

There was also some artwork that looked like they were a reskin or derivative on *first glance* but turned out not to be.  This tended to be the case especially with smaller objects (wirecutters, screwdriver, esword, etc.) and objects that had simple shapes to them. (square billboards, effects, etc.)  I also ignored objects that were too small or just a simple line. (5 pixel long cigarette, 3 pixel mustache, etc.)

I cannot say for certain that I managed to prune every goon sprite with 100% accuracy from tg's artwork.  If you are unsure about something, feel free to double check.

Upon posting this repo a few people have pointed out sprites I have missed that have been removed.  Additionally, there has been some disagreement over a few sprites that have questionable orgins.  Thus I have decided to segregate these sprites into their own folder (dubious) if everyone cannot agree it's an orginal art asset.

How You Can Help
================

If you notice a sprite in this repo that matches r4407's goon sprites please create an issue and I will remove it.  This also applies vice-versa, if you see a *original* sprite you made or know for tg that is missing, throw up an issue and I will add it back.  

Thanks!
